                <abbr title="Dyal Singh College">DSC</abbr> owes its origin to the extreme generosity and foresight of Sardar Dyal Singh Majithia,
                founder of ‘The Tribune’ and ‘Punjab National Bank’, who willed his vast wealth in 1895 for the setting u
                p of an Education Trust for a secular college. Consequently, Dyal Singh College was established at Lahore 
                in 1910, and after the Partition of India, Dyal Singh College was established in Karnal and in Delhi. It 
                started functioning in the capital as a constituent College of the University of Delhi in 1959 and was later
                taken over by the University of Delhi as a University maintained institution in 1978.
